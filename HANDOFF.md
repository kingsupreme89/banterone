## What the App Is

BanterONE is a **retail district operations mobile web app** for Banter (Signet jewelry brand). It's a **single HTML file** — no build system, no framework, no bundler. All UI is rendered via `innerHTML` replacement with a `render()` / `setState()` pattern. Data is stored in **Firebase Firestore** and syncs in real time across all users.

---

## Architecture

### HTML DOM structure
```
<main id="app">
  <div id="screen-wrap">   ← scrollable content, persistent (never replaced)
  <div id="nav-wrap">      ← bottom nav bar
  <div id="overlay-wrap">  ← modals and bottom sheets
```

The three wrapper divs are **never removed from the DOM** — only their `innerHTML` is swapped. This preserves scroll position across re-renders.

### Core patterns
- `setState(patch)` → `Object.assign(state, patch)` → `saveState()` → `render()`
- `saveState()` → writes `{email, tab}` to `localStorage`, debounce-saves user fields to Firestore
- `render()` → swaps screen HTML, preserves `scrollTop` on same-tab re-renders, rebuilds nav + overlays
- All click handling via one delegated listener on `#app` using `data-action="..."` attributes
- `data-stop` on sheet overlays blocks click-through; close buttons bypass it via `data-action` check order
- Overlays rendered into `overlayWrap` separately from the main screen — no scroll disruption

### Tech stack
- Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS (no React, no build step)
- Firebase Firestore compat SDK v10.12.2 via CDN
- GitHub Pages for hosting (via GitHub Actions workflow)
- PWA (Add to Home Screen) — manifest, apple-touch-icon, `100dvh`, `viewport-fit=cover`

## Firebase / Firestore

Firebase config is **embedded directly in the HTML** (around line 1090).
**Project:** `banterone-5cb2c`

### Collections

| Collection | Contents | Listener |
|---|---|---|
| `feed` | Shared feed posts, `orderBy("timestamp", "desc")`, limit 50 | Real-time after login |
| `reports` | Disciplinary reports, `orderBy("createdAt", "desc")` | Real-time after login |
| `users/{email}` | Per-user data document | Loaded once on login; saved on change |

### Feed post document shape
```js
{
  name, initials, authorEmail,
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp,   // server timestamp
  flair: "shoutout" | "news" | "update",
  pinned: boolean,
  text: string,
  reactions: { like: 0, heart: 0, laugh: 0, fire: 0, party: 0 }
}
```
Post IDs are **Firestore string document IDs** (not numbers).

### Disciplinary report document shape
```js
{
  employeeName, employeeEmail, storeId,
  type: "coaching" | "written-warning" | "final-warning" | "pip",
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  createdAt: Firestore.Timestamp,
  notes, issuedBy
}
```

### Per-user Firestore fields (`users/{email}`)
`buddy`, `charges`, `chargesEarned`, `rubies`, `myReactions`, `toggles`, `userOverrides`, `districtName`, `unread`, `userPhoto`

### Firestore rules
Currently **test mode** (open read/write). Must tighten before production.

## State Shape (key fields)

```js
{
  tab: "home",                      // active screen
  selectedUserEmail: "...",         // logged-in user's email
  userPhoto: "",                    // base64 JPEG 120×120

  buddy: { level, xp, xpNext, care, spark, bond },
  charges: { feed, train, cheer },  // earned on login from daily sales
  chargesEarned: bool,
  rubies: "$128",                   // St. Jude counter
  myReactions: { "postId_key": true },
  toggles: { notifPush, notifEmail, notifAchievements, soundOn, ... },
  userOverrides: { "email": { name } },  // profile name edits
  districtName: "District 4 — Colorado",
  disciplinaryReports: [],          // populated by Firestore listener
  feed: [],                         // populated by Firestore listener

  // Ephemeral UI state (not saved to Firestore)
  settingsOpen, settingsView,
  composeOpen, composeText, editingPostId,
  flairOpen, pendingFlair,
  postMenuId,                       // string Firestore doc ID of open ⋯ menu
  reportsOpen, newReportOpen,
  infoOpen, notifOpen,
  calendarOpen, calendarMonth, calendarYear, calendarSelectedDay,
  train,                            // null | { step, lessonId, answers }
  toast,
}
```

## Known Issues / Pending Work

- **Firestore rules are open** (test mode) — needs real rules before wider rollout
- **Profile photos only show for own posts** — other users' post avatars still show initials. Fix: store `authorPhoto` field on post document at publish time (`state.userPhoto` at moment of posting)
- **No push notifications** — would need Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **App to App Store:** HTML/PWA → wrap with **Capacitor** when ready to ship (few days of work, not a rewrite)
- **Genies Avatar SDK** is Unity-only; cannot be used in this web app. Could be used if the app is rebuilt native
